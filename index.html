          <em>An online learning platform for <strong>Ethiopian</strong> medical students.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Awlogson is enlighten me in Ge'ez. Medical school is a content and concept heavy field that is very demanding. It can be and is definitely overwhelming as the year's progress. And without God's help it is impossible to make it through and
          become
          a physician. We opened this platform as a way of supporting other medical students that with any difficulties that they may face while approaching their course material. What makes our platform uniques is that we give explain medical topics
          in
          Amharic making it easier for Ethiopian medical students to understand and internalize the topic avoiding last minute cramming before exams. We named our platform Awlogson as a plea to God so that He may enlighten both the ones providing the
          knowledge and the ones receiving it.
